        <h2>About Catalyst Academy</h2>
        <p>
          Catalyst Academy is an organization dedicated to reframing the narrative for individuals seeking a profound transformation. While expertly tailored for returning citizens (ex-offenders), its universal principles of leadership, resilience, and entrepreneurship empower all individuals to unlock their potential and become pillars of their communities.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Mission (Our "Why")</h3>
        <p>
          Catalyst Academy was born from a simple, powerful belief: a person's past does not dictate their future. We exist to provide a structured pathway for individuals to transform their lives, not just by finding a job, but by rediscovering their purpose, reclaiming their narrative, and becoming leaders in their own communities. Our mission is to dignify the experience of returning citizens, help them build unshakable self-worth, and empower them to become productive, respected leaders in society.
        </p>
        <h3>Who is this program for?</h3>
        <p>
          While our curriculum is expertly tailored to address the unique challenges faced by returning citizens, the principles of renewal and leadership are universal. This journey is for anyone who is ready to build a new future, is deeply committed to personal growth, believes in the power of community, and aspires to be a positive force for change. We welcome applications from any individual who is returning to the community after a period of incarceration.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Core Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> We provide the tools, resources, and unwavering support for individuals to reclaim their narratives and build futures of their own design.</li>
          <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Our curriculum fosters continuous personal and professional development, cultivating resilience and leadership from within.</li>
          <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> We champion systemic change, challenging stigmas and creating pathways for our participants to become celebrated community leaders.</li>
        </ul>
